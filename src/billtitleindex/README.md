BillTitleIndex
=======================

## Update recent BillStatus XML Files:

Bill data is primarily collected by using [unitedstates/congress](https://github.com/acxz/congress/tree/python-package), which covers 2013 to the present.

This project collects data from [the official congressional XML data on legislation](https://github.com/usgpo/bill-status), which covers the 113th Congress (2013) to the present.

### Setup and how to use unitedstates/congress
- Setup

    System dependencies on ubuntu
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install git python3-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libz-dev python3-pip python3-venv
    ```

    Python depencies
    
    It's recommended you use a `virtualenv` (virtual environment) for development. Finally, with your virtual environment activated, install the python packages, which will pull in the python dependencies automatically:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

- How to use it for collecting data

    The process using this tool has 2 parts. First, the XML data must be fetched from [Govinfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/). The script pulls the bill status XML and on subsequent runs only pulls new and changed files:

    ```bash
    usc-run govinfo --bulkdata=BILLSTATUS
    ```

    Then run the bills task to process any new and changed files:

    ```bash
    usc-run bills
    ```

    All above commands should be executed in the directory that is the parent of `data` directory.

    It's recommended to do this two-step process no more than every 6 hours, as the data is not updated more frequently than that (and often really only once daily).

    **NOTE**

    To get the bulk data of bill status before 2013, we can use the [ProPublica bulk downloads page](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/congressional-data-bulk-legislation-bills). 
    
    Data is provided in both JSON and XML formats.
    
    Bulk data from previous congresses can be downloaded by clicking the links below. Bulk data for congresses before and including the 112th was generated by the Sunlight Foundation. Data for congresses the 113th Congress and subsequent congresses was generated by ProPublica, using code from the [@UnitedStates GitHub organization](https://github.com/unitedstates).

## Pipeline

### setup dependencies

    ```bash
    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install gcc -y
    apt-get intall python3.x python3.x-dev
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### ES-Docker deployment

```bash
cd <project-root>/es-docker
mkdir data1
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./data1
# run es service as a background
sudo docker-compose up -d

# down service
sudo docker-compose down
```

### PostgreSQL deployment

Deploy PostgreSQL instance as a docker container. After that, setup project user in DB.
```postgresql
postgres=# create user btiadmin with encrypted password 'btiadmin';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# grant all on database billtitle to btiadmin;
GRANT
```

### Setup Environment Variables

Setup system environment variable
```bash
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add following line in `.bashrc` file depending on Dev or Prod server
```edit
export ENVIRONMENT=DEV
```

After that:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Edit `<project>/billtitleindex/billtitleindex/settings/.env`. Configure project secretkey, DB username and password.

### Run pipeline

To store and index bill data, run pipeline with following command.    

```bash
source <project virtualenv>/env/bin/activate
cd <project_dir>/billtitleindex
python manage.py runpipeline
```

## FastAPI run

### Run API

```bash
uvicorn billtitleindex.wsgi:app --reload
```
### Sample response

We can use `request.rest` to check the sample response of API endpoints
